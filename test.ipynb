The Paterson school district held ceremonies\\nin the morning and the afternoon as temperatures soared to nearly 100 degrees.\\nOfficials halted the second ceremony about an hour after it had started due to\\nthe heat.\\n\\nAnd in New Hampshire, two 16-year-old hikers were rescued from a mountain in\\nJaffrey late Monday afternoon, overcome by the heat, the New Hampshire Fish\\nand Game Department said. They were described as being in and out of\\nconsciousness and taken to a hospital.\\n\\nThe heat hit New York City as residents headed to the polls for the city’s\\nprimary election. In Queens, Rekha Malhotra was handing out flyers in support\\nof Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani while wearing a pink electric\\nfan around their neck.\\n\\n“It’s 90 bazillian degrees and here I am,” said Malhotra. “I could have been\\nphone banking.”\\n\\n“I have all the things — hat, ice and this,” Malhotra added, clutching a\\ncommercial-grade spray bottle.\\n\\nUtilities across the Midwest and East braced for the surge of extra demand in\\nthe heat, at times asking people to cut back on air conditioning when it felt\\nlike it was needed the most. In Memphis, Tennessee, residents were asked to\\nturn off unnecessary lights and electronics, wait until nighttime to use\\ndishwashers, washing machines dryers, and raise thermostats a few degrees, if\\nhealth allows.\\n\\n## No relief at night\\n\\nThe heat and humidity during the day was compounded by humid nights where the\\ntemperatures don’t drop much and the human body and the electric bill don’t\\nget a break to recover, said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at\\nClimate Central.\\n\\n“The longer the heat lasts, the more it wears on the body, the more it wears\\non the health,” Woods Placky said.\\n\\nA good rule of thumb is the temperature has to get at least as low as 75\\ndegrees, if not lower, for people to recover, McMahon said. That’s a lesson\\nfrom the [Pacific Northwest heat wave of\\n2021](https://apnews.com/article/heat-waves-health-coronavirus-pandemic-\\nenvironment-and-nature-790f3c7348cb0b8fa835f259c1e18c14), when many of the\\ndeaths were older people who lived at home and died at night because it wasn’t\\ngetting cool enough, she said.\\n\\n“Unlike other weather hazards, heat does have that compounding effect on the\\nhuman body. Your body tolerates less and less heat as the days go on,” McMahon\\nsaid.\\n\\nBecause warmer air from human-caused climate change holds more moisture,\\nmaking it more humid, summer nights are actually heating up faster than summer\\ndays, Woods Placky said. That’s why the Dust Bowl of the 1930s hit high\\ntemperatures similar to now, but it wasn’t as warm overall because the nights\\ncooled, she said.\\n\\nThe United States daytime summer high temperature has increased 2.2 degrees\\nFahrenheit since 1975, but the nighttime lowest temperature is now on average\\n2.6 degrees higher, according to NOAA data. In Baltimore, summer nights have\\nwarmed 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1975, while summer days only 1.5 degrees,\\nthe data showed.\\n\\nMarc Savenor, who owns Acme Ice and Dry Ice Company in Cambridge,\\nMassachusetts, struggled to keep up with phones ringing as the heat wave\\noverwhelmed ice machines and refrigerators, forcing customers to seek\\nemergency supplies.\\n\\n“During the heat waves, my phone will ring at 3 in the morning till 11 at\\nnight,” Savenor said as workers shoveled dry ice into pellets. “There’s no\\nhelp for the weary here, because you’ve got to get it when it’s coming in and\\neverybody wants some.”\\n\\nAir conditioners and fans have been flying off the shelves at Khan Electronics\\nin Queens, owner Mudassar Khan said.\\n\\n“It started getting hot at night. People buy air conditioners when they feel\\nuncomfortable at night,” Khan said.\\n\\n“Relief is coming,” Maue said, predicting that on Friday, New York City\\nprobably won’t even get into the 70s. “It’ll feel incredible.”\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Cedar Attanasio in New York; Bruce Shipkowski in\\nTrenton, New Jersey; Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee; Rodrigue Ngowi in\\nBoston; and Patrick Whittle in Portland, Maine, contributed.\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial\\nsupport from multiple private foundations.
